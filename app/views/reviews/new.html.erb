<h1>New review</h1>
<%
=begin %>

I am struggling here, the other train of thoughts is : create a review with a clean form
From main/reviews/new and let the user chose the rocks he can review only from is past booking

<%
=end %>

<%= simple_form_for [@booking, @review] do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :content %>
  <%= f.input :rating %>
  <%= f.submit "Submit review", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
<% end %>
